# Offer Comparison Form

This application was built to allow real estate agents to populate a series of streamlit form containers that contain data related to different offers for a single property. The application will return the Estimated Total Net Proceeds value for each offer.

The application will then produce an Excel file that the real estate agent can save locally, print to PDF or print to hard-copy.

# Scripts

There are two main python scripts
- offer_comparison_app.py
- comparison_to_excel.py

The offer_comparison_app.py script is what created the Streamlit application

The comparison_to_excel.py script is the code that creates an MS Excel file that can be downloaded upon use of the application
